          At Ethical Eats, we believe that ethical eating should be personal, sustainable, and impactful. We help you make food choices that align with your values while ensuring your health and well-being.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 text-gray-700">
          Every year, millions of people choose to eat more ethically. However, 84% of people who start vegetarian or vegan diets eventually abandon them. This isn't because they don't care - it's because these one-size-fits-all approaches don't account for individual values, priorities, or lifestyles.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
          Through data-driven insights and personalized recommendations, we empower you to make ethical food choices that are both impactful and sustainable, while ensuring your nutritional needs are met. It's not just about what you don't eatâ€”it's about making every meal count toward the change you want to see in the world.
